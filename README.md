## ✨ Why This Project?

This wasn’t built just to showcase skills — it was built as a **reminder of gratitude**.  
Mentors like **Striver, Shradha Khapra, Arsh Goyal, Kushal Vijay, Rohit Negi,LinkedIn connections, and Academic Mentors**, and many others quietly shaped my mindset, approach, and confidence.

> “Inspired by Mentors. Built by Learners.”
